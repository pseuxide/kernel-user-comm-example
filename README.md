Nothing special, just my learning milestone

The windows kernel driver which boosts the priority of your preferred thread in the rate of 1 to 31.

Install and start the driver, then run client.exe with thread id and desired priority. ( do it in the elevated privilege )

It works fine in my virtual machine environment.
